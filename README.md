##### abstract

In this paper I compare different machine learning techniques to classify famous artworks. Artworks are representative of high dimensional, sparse, spatial-temporal dependent rich data, which may prove problematic when applying statistical machinery. We show that classical statistical methods can achieve results on par with the cutting edge. 

Additionally, the transfer learning instance is indicative of the modular nature of modern deep learning frameworks: providing an illustration of the modularity of these frameworks, which allow one to plug \& play with model components - an extremely desirable feature.
